    "- Interacting atomically with two Dapps\n",
    "- Interacting with various types of on-chain exchanges as a trader\n",
    "- Hands-on experience using Uniswap V3 as an LP\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites \n",
    "- Metamask extension should be installed on the browser, if not, install Metamask from [here](https://metamask.io/).\n",
    "- Sign up for an HTTP web3 provider service such as Infura. The function of a provider is to answer queries about the state of the contract that can be later used to make a trade and post transactions containing the swaps onto the testnet.\n",
