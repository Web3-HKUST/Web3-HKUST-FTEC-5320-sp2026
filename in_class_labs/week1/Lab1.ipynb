    "## Browsing Web3\n",
    "\n",
    "Browsing is the most basic functionality one is familiar with on Web 2. It allows us to explore and interact with websites and follow links. Similarly, we look at ways to browse Web 3.\n",

    "\n",
    "### [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/)\n",
    "Etherscan is the blockchain explorer for the Ethereum network, functioning as a search engine for the blockchain. It allows users to browse at the most granular level, providing transparency by letting you view individual transactions, verify smart contracts, and track all tokens and entities involved in specific operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [MEV-explore](https://writings.flashbots.net/)\n",
    "Maximal Extractable Value (MEV) is a measure of how much value can be extracted by manipulating transaction order or by inserting/removing transactions, while playing by the protocol rules. This has been identified as a strong \"centralizing force\" in DeFi. MEV-Explore allows us to measure that and other related statistics on the Ethereum blockchain.\n",

    "## Apps on Web3\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us now walk through prominent applications whose functions constitute the \"elements\" of decentralized finance.\n",
    "### [Uniswap](https://app.uniswap.org/#/swap) \n",
    "\n",
    "Uniswap is a decentralized exchange platform. It is primarily used to swap tokens by traders, and to earn trading fees by liquidity providers. Many liquidity providers pool their assets together and these are used by traders to buy and sell tokens.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How is Uniswap different from a traditional exchange like NYSE ?\n",
    "  - Potential answer: Uniswap operates as a decentralized protocol that uses automated market maker (AMM) smart contracts and user-funded liquidity pools rather than a centralized entity with an order book and intermediaries.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [OpenSea](https://opensea.io/)\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenSea is a web3 marketplace for Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs) and crypto collectibles. Functioning as a comprehensive decentralized exchange, it allows creators and collectors to explore, mint, buy, and sell digital assets, such as art, music, gaming items, etc, across multiple blockchains seamlessly.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Aave](https://app.aave.com/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Aave is a leading decentralized non-custodial liquidity protocol that facilitates borrowing and lending. Users can deposit digital assets into liquidity pools to earn interest or borrow cryptocurrencies by using their deposits as collateral. It is a cornerstone of the DeFi ecosystem, offering advanced features like Flash Loans and variable interest rates. \n",
    "\n",
    "- What are the actions one can perform on Aave?\n",
    "  - Potential answer: Users on Aave can primarily supply assets to earn interest, borrow various cryptocurrencies against their deposits, repay loans, and utilize advanced tools like flash loans.\n",
    "- What tokens can be borrowed? What are the requirements for borrowing on Aave?\n",
    "  - Potential answer: One can borrow a wide range of supported ERC-20 assets provided they first deposit sufficient collateral to ensure the loan remains over-collateralized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Chainlink](https://data.chain.link/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Chainlink is the industry-standard decentralized oracle network that bridges the gap between smart contracts and the real world. It securely connects blockchains to off-chain data, APIs, and payment systems. Notably, its Data Feeds provide tamper-proof, real-time price updates on-chain, serving as critical infrastructure for the DeFi ecosystem. \n",
    "\n",
    "- In Chainlink, what data feeds are available? When are they updated?\n",
    "  - Potential answer: Chainlink offers feeds for crypto asset prices, forex, commodities, and proof of reserves, which update on-chain whenever a defined time interval passes or the data value deviates by a specific percentage. \n",
    "- Where might these be useful?\n",
    "  - Potential answer: These data feeds are essential for decentralized finance (DeFi) protocols to accurately calculate collateralization ratios, trigger liquidations, settle synthetic asset trades, and verify stablecoin backing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### [dYdX](https://dydx.exchange/)\n",
    "dYdX is a leading non-custodial decentralized exchange (DEX) designed for advanced trading. Unlike automated market makers (AMM), it utilizes the order book model to offer perpetual futures with leverage. Traders can buy and sell over many kinds of cryptocurrencies, including BTC and ETH, with low fees while retaining full control of their assets.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/#/)\n",
    "\n",
    "Snapshot is a widely used voting platform that streamlines decentralized governance for DAOs and crypto protocols. Instead of expensive on-chain transactions, it utilizes off-chain signing techniques (IPFS) to allow token holders to vote on proposals gas-free. This ensures community participation remains accessible and verifiable without the barrier of transaction costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does a proposal look like in Snapshot? \n",
    "  - Potential answer: A Snapshot proposal typically presents a clear interface containing a title, a detailed description of the issue, multiple voting options, the voting strategy type, and the start and end dates for participation.\n",
    "- What does a proposal typically decide and is it truly decentralized in Snapshot?\n",
    "  - Potential answer: Proposals usually decide on treasury spending or protocol parameters, but since Snapshot is an off-chain signaling tool that often requires a multi-sig wallet to execute the final decision, it is not considered fully decentralized autonomous governance. \n",
